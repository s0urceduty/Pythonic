Sourceduty approaches Pythonic language and software architecture with a focus on clean, modular, and scalable design patterns that align with Python’s philosophy of simplicity and readability. At its core, Sourceduty emphasizes writing expressive, idiomatic Python code—leveraging features like list comprehensions, generators, decorators, and context managers to keep code elegant yet powerful. It enforces PEP8 styling through automated linters and formatters such as Black and Flake8, ensuring uniformity across large collaborative codebases. When editing or extending codebases, Sourceduty encourages dependency injection, interface segregation, and type hinting using Python’s typing module or pydantic, which improves maintainability and supports robust tooling for static analysis. Functional constructs are used where appropriate, but readability and clarity take precedence over cleverness, a reflection of the Zen of Python.
